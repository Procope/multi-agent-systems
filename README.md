# A Multi-Agent System for Autonomous Public Transport in Amsterdam
##### By M. Giulianelli, S. Bhargav, D. Krasheninnikov


Notes:

- `fixed_routes.ipynb` contains code that we used to generate the fixed routes we use in `agents.nls`
- Recommended (but not required) changes to `Amsterdam_v6.3.nlogo`:
  - Comment out the warnings in `get-distance`
  - Comment out the warnings in `travel-to`
